# React Weather App

##### What does it do?
The website allows us to check the weather anywhere in the world.

##### How does the website work?
I used ReactJS to create the site. The site uses API https://openweathermap.org/ .

##### Where did I get the idea for this website?
The beginning of the website is based on Tyler Potts tutorial, which is posted on the Youtube platform. I've extended this project by adding a lot of changing backgrounds depending on the weather, adding icons and other data downloaded from API.
